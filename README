Based on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe#Strategy

  A player can play perfect tic-tac-toe (win or draw) given they move according to the highest possible move from the following table.
  
  Win: If the player has two in a row, play the third to get three in a row.
  
  Block: If the opponent has two in a row, play the third to block them.
  
  Fork: Create an opportunity where you can win in two ways.
  
  Block opponent's fork:
    Option 1: Create two in a row to force the opponent into defending, as long as it doesn't result in them creating a fork or winning. For example, if "X" has a corner, "O" has the center, and "X" has the opposite corner as well, "O" must not play a corner in order to win. (Playing a corner in this scenario creates a fork for "X" to win.)

    Option 2: If there is a configuration where the opponent can fork, block that fork.

  Center: Play the center.

  Opposite corner: If the opponent is in the corner, play the opposite corner.

  Empty corner: Play in a corner square.

  Empty side: Play in a middle square on any of the 4 sides.
